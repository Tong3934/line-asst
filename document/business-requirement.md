## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** เช็คสิทธิ์ & เคลมประกันด่วน (Quick Insurance Eligibility Check & Claim Submission)  
**Customer Interface:** LINE Messaging App (Chatbot)  
**Internal Interface:** Web dashboards for Reviewer and Manager roles

This product is an **AI-powered LINE chatbot** that guides insurance policyholders through the complete insurance claim journey — from checking eligibility all the way to submitting a fully documented claim — without leaving the LINE app.

The customer describes their situation (or uses a trigger keyword), the system detects the claim type, generates a Claim ID, then guides identity verification. Once verified, the customer uploads required documents one at a time. The AI **automatically categorises each photo and extracts key data fields**, validates completeness, and assembles the full claim package. Once all required documents are uploaded, the customer submits the claim with a single tap.

Internally, a **Reviewer web dashboard** lets claims staff review each document, confirm extracted data, and update claim status. A **Manager web dashboard** provides real-time analytics on volumes, accuracy rates, and paid amounts.

## 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

### The Problem

| Pain Point | Who Feels It | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Long hotline wait times** | Customer | Calling the insurance hotline can take 10–30+ minutes during peak hours |
| **Uncertainty about coverage** | Customer | Customers do not know if their policy type and incident qualify for a claim |
| **Paper-heavy document submission** | Customer | Customers must physically visit a service center or mail documents |
| **Manual data re-entry** | Claims Staff | Staff manually type data from photos and scans into internal systems |
| **No visibility into document quality** | Claims Staff | Staff cannot easily flag which documents were useful or too unclear to process |
| **Fragmented analytics** | Manager | No single dashboard for claim volumes, accuracy, and amounts paid |

### The Opportunity

LINE is the most-used messaging app in Thailand (50M+ active users). Placing the entire claim experience inside LINE means:

- **Zero new app to install** — customers already have LINE
- **Camera always ready** — customers photograph documents at the scene of the incident
- **AI removes manual entry** — structured data extracted automatically from every photo
- **Faster first assessment** — reviewers receive a complete, pre-extracted claim package
- **Rich analytics** — structured data enables dashboards and process insights

---

## 3. Project Objectives

| # | Objective | Measurable Target |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Let policyholders check claim eligibility instantly without calling | Eligibility verdict in < 45 seconds |
| 2 | Let policyholders submit a complete, documented claim through LINE | End-to-end submission in < 5 minutes |
| 3 | Automate data extraction from document photos | AI extraction ≥ 90% accuracy on key fields (name, ID, dates) — verified by reviewer spot-check |
| 4 | Reduce manual intake work for claims staff | 70% of submitted claims arrive with all fields pre-extracted |
| 5 | Provide real-time dashboards for reviewers and managers | Data available within 1 minute of submission |
| 6 | Support both Car Damage and Health claim types | Both types fully functional at launch |

## 9. Business Rules

### BR-01: Claim ID Sequence
- 6-digit, zero-padded (000001, 000042)
- CD and H have **independent counters**, both persisted across restarts in `{DATA_DIR}/sequence.json`
- Thread-safe: uses `threading.Lock()` + `fcntl.flock` for concurrent container safety

### BR-02: Buddhist Era → Gregorian Date Conversion
- Thai documents use Buddhist Era (พ.ศ.) — 543 years ahead of Gregorian
- **Conversion:** Gregorian year = พ.ศ. − 543
- All stored dates use: `YYYY-MM-DD`

### BR-03: Driving License — One Per Side (With-Other-Party Claims Only)
- Keys: `driving_license_customer` and `driving_license_other_party`
- `driving_license_other_party` is required **only** when the claim sub-type is **"With other party (มีคู่กรณี)"**
- For **"No other party"** claims, only `driving_license_customer` is collected — the bot MUST NOT ask for the counterpart's license
- A second upload for an already-assigned side MUST be rejected

### BR-04: Multiple Receipts (Health Claims)
- Multiple medical receipts allowed, stored as `receipt_1`, `receipt_2`, … in `uploaded_docs`
- In `extracted_data.json` they are stored in the `medical_receipts[]` array
- No upper limit on receipt count

### BR-05: Unknown Documents Are Rejected
- "unknown" category = rejected; customer told which document types are required

### BR-06: Paid Amount Reporting
- Only claims with status **"Paid"** are counted in paid amount totals in Manager analytics

### BR-07: No Authentication (PoC)
- All web dashboard endpoints are publicly accessible in PoC scope
- Authentication required before production

### BR-08: Claim Status Lifecycle
- All claims start as **Draft** (created on trigger, before submission)
- Lifecycle: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Pending → Approved → Paid (or Rejected at any internal stage)
- Status transitions enforced by `constants.VALID_TRANSITIONS`

### BR-09: AI Token Cost Tracking
- Every Gemini API call records: timestamp, operation name, model, input tokens, output tokens, cost (USD)
- Records persisted to `/data/token_records/YYYY-MM.jsonl`
- Maximum `TOKEN_RECORD_MAX` (10,000) records kept per month

## 12. Data Requirements

### 12.1 Policy Record — Car Damage

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| id_card_number (13-digit) | 3100701443816 |
| name_th / name_en | สมชาย ใจดี / Somchai Jaidee |
| phone | 081-234-5678 |
| policy_number | CD-2026-001234 |
| vehicle_plate | กก 1234 กรุงเทพมหานคร |
| vehicle_brand / model / year / color | Toyota Camry 2.5 HV Premium, 2024, White Pearl |
| coverage_type | ชั้น 1 |
| coverage_amount (THB) | 1,000,000 |
| deductible (THB) | 5,000 |
| start_date / end_date | 2026-01-01 / 2026-12-31 |
| status | active |

### 12.2 Policy Record — Health

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| id_card_number (13-digit) | 3100701443816 |
| name_th / name_en | สมชาย ใจดี |
| plan | Gold Health Plus |
| coverage_ipd (THB) | 500,000 |
| coverage_opd (THB) | 30,000 |
| room_per_night (THB) | 5,000 |
| start_date / end_date | 2026-01-01 / 2026-12-31 |
| status | active |

### 12.3 Extracted Data Storage Keys

**Car Damage:**

| Key | Stores |
|---|---|
| `driving_license_customer` | Name, license ID, citizen ID, dates |
| `driving_license_other_party` | Same for the counterpart driver — **present only when sub-type = "With other party"** |
| `vehicle_registration` | Plate, brand, chassis, engine, model year |
| `damage_photos[]` | Filename, description, severity, GPS (from EXIF) |
| `vehicle_location_photo` | Location, road/weather conditions, GPS |

**Health:**

| Key | Stores |
|---|---|
| `citizen_id_card` | Name, citizen ID, dates |
| `medical_certificate` | Patient, diagnosis, treatment, doctor, hospital, dates |
| `itemized_bill` | Line items with amounts, total |
| `discharge_summary` | Diagnosis, treatment, admission/discharge dates |
| `medical_receipts[]` | Hospital, billing number, total paid, date, itemised amounts |

### 12.4 Claim Status Lifecycle

```
Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Pending → Approved → Paid
                                 ↘
                                  Rejected
```

> **Note:** A new claim enters `Draft` status the moment the Claim ID is generated. Status becomes `Submitted` only after the customer explicitly submits.

### 12.5 Document Accuracy Tagging (Reviewer)

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `useful: true` | Document was clear and contributed to the claim decision |
| `useful: false` | Document was unclear or did not contribute |
| `useful: null` | Not yet reviewed |

---

## 13. Out of Scope

| # | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Payment processing | Bot submits a claim; payment handled externally |
| 2 | Real-time policy database connection | PoC uses JSON files; DB integration future phase |
| 3 | Authentication for web dashboards | Required before production (BR-07) |
| 4 | Push notifications on status changes | Customer uses Claim ID to track; future feature |
| 5 | Non-car, non-health insurance types | Travel, life, property — out of scope |
| 6 | Languages beyond Thai + English | Two languages only |
| 7 | Mobile-responsive internal dashboards | Desktop browser only in PoC |
| 8 | Automated approval by AI | AI assists; human approves |
| 9 | Core insurance system integration | Future phase |
| 10 | Session persistence across restarts | In-memory `user_sessions` dict; restart clears active sessions |
| 11 | Wire `handlers/` into `main.py` for production | `handlers/` fully implemented; integration into `main.py` routing is a pending dev task |
| 12 | Serve dashboard HTML via FastAPI routes | Dashboard HTML files exist; FastAPI `/reviewer`, `/manager`, `/admin` routes not yet added |

---

## 14. Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A1 | The policyholder has a valid LINE account |
| A2 | The customer's smartphone camera produces images clear enough for AI OCR |
| A3 | Policy JSON files are pre-loaded with correct records before go-live |
| A4 | Customers consent to photos and personal data being processed by a third-party AI service |
| A5 | The AI Vision model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) can reliably read standard Thai government documents |
| A6 | The company has an active LINE Official Account with Messaging API configured |

### Constraints

| # | Constraint |
|---|---|
| C1 | PoC runs on a single Docker host — no horizontal scaling |
| C2 | ngrok free tier URL changes on restart; LINE webhook must be re-registered manually |
| C3 | AI extraction time per document up to 10 seconds depending on image complexity |
| C4 | AI token usage incurs cost; all calls must be tracked and budgeted (`ai/__init__.py` token tracking) |
| C5 | LINE rate limits apply on messages per second |
| C6 | Gemini model is `models/gemini-2.5-flash` (overridable via `GEMINI_MODEL` env var) |

---

## 15. Success Metrics (KPIs)

### Phase 1 — PoC (Months 1–3)

| KPI | Target |
|---|---|
| End-to-end submission success rate | ≥ 90% of sessions with valid policy + legible photos |
| AI document categorisation accuracy | ≥ 95% correct on first attempt |
| AI data extraction accuracy (name, ID, dates) | ≥ 90% correct values |
| Average time from trigger to submission | < 5 minutes |
| Bot recovery after error (cancel + restart) | 100% |

### Phase 2 — Production (Months 4–6)

| KPI | Target |
|---|---|
| Claims with all fields pre-extracted (no manual entry) | ≥ 70% |
| Reduction in intake errors vs. manual process | ≥ 30% fewer rejected / incomplete submissions |
| Reviewer time per claim (with dashboard) | ≥ 20% reduction vs. legacy |
| Customer satisfaction score | ≥ 4.0 / 5.0 stars |
| Monthly Active Users at 6 months | > 500 unique claimants |

## 16. Known Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | AI misreads a critical field (ID number, date), causing incorrect claim | Medium | High | Reviewer verifies all extracted data before approval |
| R2 | AI gives incorrect eligibility verdict, causing dispute | Medium | High | Mandatory disclaimer on every verdict; reviewer does independent check |
| R3 | Policy JSON file not pre-loaded with correct records before go-live | High | High | Data loading is a formal launch prerequisite |
| R4 | AI service downtime or rate limiting during peak hours | Low | High | Retry messages; session state preserved; customer can re-upload |
| R5 | Session data lost on container restart | High | Low | Acceptable PoC limitation; Redis TTL required for production |
| R6 | Customer uploads blurry, partial, or wrong document | High | Medium | AI rejects "unknown" with clear re-upload instructions |
| R7 | PII exposed in application logs | Medium | High | PII-free logging enforced; reviewed before production |
| R8 | AI token cost exceeds budget | Medium | Medium | Admin dashboard monitors cost; billing alerts; files deleted after use |
| R9 | Driving license assigned to wrong party | Medium | Medium | Explicit ownership confirmation; reviewer sees both licenses |
| R10 | ngrok tunnel breaks; LINE webhook stops | High | High | Document re-registration steps; production uses static domain |
| R11 | `handlers/` not wired into `main.py` for go-live | High | Critical | Integration of new handlers into the request routing is a dev prerequisite before production |
| R12 | Dashboard HTML not served via FastAPI routes | High | Medium | Add `/reviewer`, `/manager`, `/admin` routes to `main.py` before production |
